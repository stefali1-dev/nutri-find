read @AGENT.md.

and understand the context.
now, we're in the process of adding more nutritionists to the site. 
but I talked to them and they agreed that we can do the registering for them, with data from their site. as they are busy and can't complete the registration themselfs.
so i will give you their sites, and I want you to scrape all the needed data you can find four our nutiritonist profile.
feel free to browse their site until you find the needed data or until you are certain that it is not present. in that case, you can ask me directly.
